Wix is a perfect example of this because nobody (who has a brain) uses their enterprise plans. Wix is never used by professional developers as they are drag-and-drop, and you won't find a single name brand on the internet that is hosted by them. Their key customers are small businesses who want something cheap and easy; my guess is that they offer their expensive plans almost entirely for this effect.`

The goal of social media sites is to keep you engaged for as long as possible. Algorithms have made it possible to keep users in a bubble of only what they like. Sounds great, who wants to see posts they don't like? The downside of this is Group Polarization. When you agree with political or multi-sided content in general, you are categorized so you only see similar content in the future. You will almost never see a valid argument from "the other side". As a result, people on all sides of the political and other spectrums can easily become more extreme.`

A variable ratio schedule is a type of reinforcement schedule in operant conditioning, where a reward is dispatched randomly based on the amount of effort spent on a task. This is exactly what is occurring when you scroll through Tiktok, Facebook, Youtube, etc. Every so often, perhaps an average of every 10 posts, you come across something that makes you laugh or looks interesting. This same type of schedule is used in gambling/slot machines, and is implemented by developers in sites that generate revenue from user engagement because it is the most addictive schedule."

This is called pagination, and is the opposite of infinite scrolling. You must instead press "load more" or "next" to get more results. Pagination is usually used in sites that profit off of user decisions/purchases, not engagement. This is done not only to improve load times, but also to limit a user\'s choices to a smaller group of popular items. On the next slides you will see examples of sites (Amazon.com and Realtor.com) that use pagination to cut choices.'

Rods don\'t detect color and rather are sensitive to movement and changes in darkness.

The first will be understimulating, the second overstimulating, and the third just right (where performance would be highest)."
